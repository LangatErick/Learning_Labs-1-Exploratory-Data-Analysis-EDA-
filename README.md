Exploratory Data Analysis is one of the critical processes of performing initial investigations on data analysis.

Basic idea is to discover the patterns, anomalies, test hypotheses, and check the assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

The main idea about exploratory data analysis are

maximize insight into a data set;
uncover underlying structure;
extract important variables;
detect outliers and anomalies;
test underlying assumptions;
develop parsimonious models;
determine optimal factor settings.
