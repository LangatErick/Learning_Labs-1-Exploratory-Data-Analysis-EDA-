Exploratory Data Analysis is one of the critical processes of performing initial investigations on data analysis.

The basic idea is to discover the patterns, and anomalies, test hypotheses, and check the assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

The main idea of exploratory data analysis is

* maximize insight into a data set;
* uncover underlying structure;
* extract important variables;
* detect outliers and anomalies;
* test underlying assumptions;
* develop parsimonious models;
* determine optimal factor settings.

# Visualization
Most EDA techniques are graphical with a few quantitative techniques. Here we are going to explain different kinds of visualization techniques to identify the patterns and relationships.

# Conclusion
Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach to identify every nuance from the data at the early encounter and it plays a crucial role in the data analysis field.
